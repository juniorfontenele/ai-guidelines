## Tasks

### DOC-01 Write comprehensive README

**Description**:
Create the main README.md file that serves as the entry point for all package documentation. The README should provide a clear overview of the package, its purpose, key features, and quick start guide. It should be well-organized, visually appealing, and cover all major use cases at a high level with links to detailed documentation.

Follow standard Laravel package README structure: badges, installation, basic usage, configuration, advanced features, testing, contributing, license. Include code examples that are copy-pastable and work out of the box.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] AC-1: Overview section explaining what the package does and why it's useful
- [ ] AC-2: Features list highlighting key capabilities (session persistence, job propagation, HTTP integration, custom sources)
- [ ] AC-3: Requirements section (Laravel 12, PHP 8.4+)
- [ ] AC-4: Quick start guide with installation and zero-config usage example
- [ ] AC-5: Links to detailed sections (installation, configuration, usage, custom sources)
- [ ] AC-6: Badges for build status, coverage, version, license
- [ ] AC-7: Clear table of contents for easy navigation
- [ ] AC-8: License section (MIT or project license)

**Technical Notes**:
- Keep README concise (detailed content goes in separate sections)
- Use markdown formatting for readability
- Include practical examples that developers can run immediately

**Files to Create/Modify**:
- `README.md`

**Testing**:
- [ ] No tests needed (documentation only)
- [ ] Verify all links work
- [ ] Verify code examples are syntactically correct

### DOC-02 Add installation guide

**Description**:
Write detailed installation instructions covering all installation scenarios: basic installation via Composer, package auto-discovery, config publishing, and environment variable setup. Include instructions for both new projects and existing projects with custom configurations.

Cover common installation issues and how to verify the package is working correctly. Include Laravel 12-specific setup if needed.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] AC-1: Basic installation via `composer require jftecnologia/laravel-tracing`
- [ ] AC-2: Explain Laravel auto-discovery (zero-config setup)
- [ ] AC-3: Config publishing instructions: `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=laravel-tracing-config`
- [ ] AC-4: Environment variable setup (LARAVEL_TRACING_ENABLED, header names, etc.)
- [ ] AC-5: Verification steps (make request, check response headers)
- [ ] AC-6: Common installation issues and troubleshooting
- [ ] AC-7: Upgrading from previous versions (if applicable)

**Technical Notes**:
- Installation should work with zero configuration (sensible defaults)
- Config publishing is optional (for customization)
- Clear separation between required and optional steps

**Files to Create/Modify**:
- `README.md` (Installation section)

**Testing**:
- [ ] No tests needed (documentation only)
- [ ] Verify installation steps work on fresh Laravel 12 project
- [ ] Verify published config has all expected keys

### DOC-03 Add configuration reference

**Description**:
Document all available configuration options with descriptions, default values, and examples. Cover global toggles (enabled, accept_external_headers), per-tracing settings (enabled, header, source), HTTP client settings, and environment variable mappings.

Organize configuration docs by category (global settings, built-in tracings, custom tracings, HTTP client). Include examples for common configuration scenarios (disable tracing in local, custom header names, add custom tracing).

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] AC-1: Document all config keys in `config/laravel-tracing.php`
- [ ] AC-2: Explain `enabled` global toggle with examples
- [ ] AC-3: Explain `accept_external_headers` toggle with security implications
- [ ] AC-4: Document `tracings` array structure (enabled, header, source)
- [ ] AC-5: Document `http_client.enabled` setting
- [ ] AC-6: List all environment variables with mappings (LARAVEL_TRACING_ENABLED, etc.)
- [ ] AC-7: Provide configuration examples for common scenarios
- [ ] AC-8: Document default values for all settings

**Technical Notes**:
- Configuration reference should be comprehensive (cover all options)
- Include security notes for `accept_external_headers`
- Examples should demonstrate real use cases

**Files to Create/Modify**:
- `README.md` (Configuration section)

**Testing**:
- [ ] No tests needed (documentation only)
- [ ] Verify all config keys are documented
- [ ] Verify examples work as described

---

### DOC-04 Add usage examples

**Description**:
Provide practical usage examples covering all major features: accessing tracing values, session persistence, job propagation, HTTP client integration, and custom tracings. Each example should be complete, runnable, and demonstrate a real use case.

Include examples for controllers, jobs, services, middleware, and HTTP client usage. Show how to use the `LaravelTracing` facade and how tracing values integrate with logging and debugging workflows.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] AC-1: Example: Accessing tracing values in controllers via `LaravelTracing::all()`
- [ ] AC-2: Example: Using tracings in log context (`Log::info('message', LaravelTracing::all())`)
- [ ] AC-3: Example: Accessing tracings in job handlers
- [ ] AC-4: Example: Forwarding tracings to external APIs via `Http::withTracing()`
- [ ] AC-5: Example: Session persistence (same correlation ID across requests)
- [ ] AC-6: Example: Multiple jobs dispatched from same request share correlation ID
- [ ] AC-7: Code examples are complete and runnable
- [ ] AC-8: Examples follow Laravel best practices

**Technical Notes**:
- Examples should be practical and realistic
- Show integration with Laravel features (logging, queues, HTTP client)
- Include expected output or behavior for each example

**Files to Create/Modify**:
- `README.md` (Usage Examples section)

**Testing**:
- [ ] No tests needed (documentation only)
- [ ] Verify examples are syntactically correct
- [ ] Verify examples work in actual Laravel application

### DOC-05 Add custom tracing guide

**Description**:
Write a detailed guide on how to create, register, and use custom tracing sources. Cover implementing the `TracingSource` contract, registering via config, registering via runtime extension, and replacing built-in sources. Include complete examples and best practices.

## Summary

**Total Tasks**: 6
**Estimated Complexity**: Low
**Dependencies**: All epics (documents implemented features)

**Critical Path**:
- DOC-01 is the foundation (main README structure)
- DOC-02, DOC-03, DOC-04, DOC-05, DOC-06 can be done in parallel (each documents a specific area)
- All depend on completed implementation (can't document features that don't exist)
