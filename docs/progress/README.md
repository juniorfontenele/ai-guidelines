## Development Order

Follow this recommended order based on dependencies:

1. **Core Tracing Infrastructure (CTI)** - Start here (no dependencies)
2. **Configuration System (CFG)** - After CTI
3. **Session Persistence (SP) + Request ID Management (RIM)** - Parallel after CTI + CFG
4. **Middleware Integration (MI)** - After CTI, CFG, SP, RIM
5. **Service Provider Bootstrap (SPB)** - After MI
6. **Job Propagation (JP) + HTTP Client Integration (HCI)** - Parallel after SPB
7. **Custom Tracing Sources (CTS)** - After SPB
8. **Documentation (DOC)** - Final phase

## Notes

### Project Status
- **Stage**: Initial skeleton
- **Last Activity**: Task breakdown created (2026-02-10)
- **Ready to Start**: Yes - begin with CTI-01

### Decisions Made
- Task breakdown follows architecture from docs/architecture/
- All 19 functional requirements (FR-01 to FR-19) are covered
- 43 tasks organized into 10 epics
- Dependencies clearly mapped

### Next Steps
1. Review task breakdown in docs/tasks/
2. Start implementation with CTI-01 (Implement core contracts)
3. Follow development workflow from docs/engineering/WORKFLOW.md
4. Update this file as tasks progress

---

## Quick Reference

### Starting a Task

1. Check this README for recommended next task
2. Read task definition in docs/tasks/[epic-name].md
3. Update epic progress file: set status to `IN_PROGRESS`
4. Update this README: add to "Current Focus"
5. Implement according to acceptance criteria
6. Run `composer lint` before committing
7. Update progress file when complete

### Completing a Task

1. Verify all acceptance criteria pass
2. Run `composer lint` (mandatory)
3. Run `composer test` (if tests exist)
4. Commit with semantic message
5. Update epic progress file:
   - Set status to `DONE`
   - Add commit hash
   - Add timestamps
6. Update this README: move to "Recent Completions"
7. Pick next task

### Handling Issues

**If task fails:**
- Update status to `FAILED`
- Document what went wrong in Notes
- Add to "Failed Items" table in this README
- Determine if retryable or needs architecture change

**If task blocked:**
- Update status to `BLOCKED`
- Document blocker in epic progress file
- Add to "Blocked Items" table in this README
- Ask user for decision/clarification
