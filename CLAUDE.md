# Claude Code — Project Guidelines

**Laravel application or package** — AI-assisted development guidelines template.
All detailed behavior is loaded from **skills** and **docs/** files.

---

## 1. Source of Truth Hierarchy

1. Explicit user instructions
2. Active skill files under `.agents/skills/**/SKILL.md`
3. Project documentation under `docs/`
4. This `CLAUDE.md`
5. Existing code patterns
6. Framework conventions

Never override a skill or documentation rule using assumptions.

---

## 2. Template Development Workflow

This template supports a structured AI-assisted development flow. For the complete lifecycle, skill routing, and quality gates, see `docs/AGENT_FLOW.md`.

0. **`/init-project`** — First-time setup: detect project context, adapt guidelines
1. **`/brainstorming`** — Structure ideas, explore options, refine specs in `docs/brainstorming/`
2. **`/generate-prd`** — Define product requirements in `docs/PRD.md`
3. **`/generate-architecture`** — Create system architecture in `docs/architecture/`
4. **`/generate-ui-design`** — Define UI/UX design specifications in `docs/design/`
5. **`/generate-task-breakdown`** — Break requirements into tasks in `docs/tasks/`
6. **`/task-planner`** — Plan and optionally implement a specific task/feature (standalone)
7. **`/implement-task`** — Implement individual tasks with quality gates

**Alternative**: **`/task-planner`** — Plan features, tasks, or refactors from natural language descriptions. Routes to `implement-task` for execution after approval.

**Operational workflows** (slash commands for common operations):

| Workflow         | Purpose                                       |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `/helpme`        | Universal orchestrator — routes to best skill |
| `/full-pipeline` | Guide the full development lifecycle          |
| `/code-review`   | Pre-PR lint, test, security review            |
| `/deploy`        | Pre-deploy checklist                          |
| `/preview`       | Start dev server + browser preview            |
| `/status`        | Project progress overview                     |
| `/add-stack`     | Add/activate stack packs                      |
| `/debug`         | Structured debugging flow                     |
| `/refactor`      | Refactoring with safety checks                |
| `/test`          | Run or generate tests                         |
| `/docs`          | Generate/update documentation                 |
| `/improve-ui`    | UI/UX audit and improvement                   |
| `/i18n`          | Translation audit, fix, and sync              |

**Mandatory gates**: Security and i18n are enforced at both planning and post-code stages. See `docs/AGENT_FLOW.md` §3.

Additional skills for development:

| Skill                       | When to use                                                |

| Stack Pack     | When to use                                         |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `stack-node`   | Node.js/TypeScript patterns, quality gates, testing |

| `stack-go`     | Go patterns, quality gates, testing                 |

> Stack packs are **additive layers**. They add patterns and quality gates for the target stack without removing existing skills. Core skills remain available regardless of stack.

Before performing a task: search for a relevant skill, follow it strictly, do not mix responsibilities.

## 3. How to Find Information

### Documentation (`docs/`)

| Topic                | Location                                |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Product requirements | `docs/PRD.md`                           |
| Feature PRDs         | `docs/prd/*.md`                         |
| Roles & Permissions  | `docs/RBAC_GUIDE.md`                    |
| System architecture  | `docs/architecture/*.md`                |
| UI/UX design specs   | `docs/design/*.md`                      |
| Development tasks    | `docs/tasks/*.md`                       |
| Progress tracking    | `docs/progress/*.md`                    |
| Brainstorming docs   | `docs/brainstorming/*.md`               |
| Tech stack           | `docs/engineering/STACK.md`             |
| Code standards       | `docs/engineering/CODE_STANDARDS.md`    |
| Git workflow         | `docs/engineering/WORKFLOW.md`          |
| Testing guidelines   | `docs/engineering/TESTING.md`           |
| Quality gates        | `docs/engineering/QUALITY_GATES.md`     |
| Database patterns    | `docs/engineering/DATABASE_PATTERNS.md` |
| Deploy / CI          | `docs/engineering/DEPLOY.md` (TODO)     |
| Persona profiles     | `docs/personas/*.md`                    |
| Persona feedbacks    | `docs/feedbacks/**/*.md`                |
| Agent flow           | `docs/AGENT_FLOW.md`                    |

Search `docs/` before asking questions. Prefer existing documents over assumptions.

### Laravel Boost (MCP Tools)

Always use `search-docs` before making code changes to ensure correct approach. Use multiple broad queries: `['rate limiting', 'routing rate limiting', 'routing']`. Do not add package names to queries.

Other useful tools: `tinker`, `database-schema`, `database-query`, `last-error`, `browser-logs`, `list-routes`, `get-absolute-url`.

## 4. Development Philosophy

- No DDD — no unnecessary abstraction
- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- SOLID, pragmatically applied
- Configuration over hard-coded logic
- Extensible and pluggable by default
- Fluent classes
- Design for internationalization (i18n)

**Complete standards**: `docs/engineering/CODE_STANDARDS.md`

## 5. Application Structure

```text
app/
├── Actions/          # Single-purpose actions (grouped by domain)
├── Enums/            # PHP enums
├── Events/           # Domain events
├── Exceptions/       # Custom exceptions
├── Extensions/       # Package customizations (non-domain logic)
├── Http/             # Controllers, Middleware, Requests
├── Jobs/             # Queued jobs
├── Listeners/        # Event listeners
├── Models/           # Eloquent models
├── Notifications/    # Notification classes
├── Policies/         # Authorization policies
├── Providers/        # Service providers
├── Rules/            # Custom validation rules
├── Services/         # Orchestration services
└── Support/          # Helpers (helpers.php)
```

Key conventions:

- **Actions** for single-purpose operations, **Services** for orchestration
- **Extensions** for package customizations only (not domain logic)
- **Form Requests** for all validation (never inline in controllers)
- **Named routes** + Wayfinder for frontend route references — always prefer Wayfinder; hard-coded URLs only as a last resort with explicit justification in comments
- **Artisan commands first** — Always use `php artisan make:*` and other artisan commands when available. Before manually creating files, check `php artisan list` for available generators. This applies to framework commands and installed package commands alike. Artisan ensures compatibility with the framework and package conventions.
- **Demo seeders** — Create demo/development seeders in `database/seeders/Demo/` for testing. Run: `php artisan db:seed --class='Database\Seeders\Demo\DemoSeeder'`. Seeders are for demo data only — system data belongs in migrations.

---

## 6. Quality Gates

See `docs/engineering/QUALITY_GATES.md` for the full specification. Gates run in order: Lint → Test → i18n → Security.

Quick reference — before commits:

```bash
composer lint                    # PHP: format + rector + analyze
npm run lint && npm run types    # JS/TS: ESLint + TypeScript
```

Before PRs: also run `composer test`. During AI development: `vendor/bin/pint --dirty --format agent`.

---

## 7. Version Freshness

On the **first interaction** with a project, verify that documentation matches the actual project:

1. Check actual PHP, Laravel, Node, and key package versions (via `application-info` MCP tool or `composer.json`/`package.json`)
2. Compare with versions documented in `docs/engineering/STACK.md`
3. If discrepancies are found, **update the docs** to reflect reality
4. When the project specializes (e.g., adds multi-tenancy, changes auth strategy), update relevant guidelines to match

This ensures guidelines never drift from the actual project state.

---

## 8. Language Rules

- Code, commits, branches, PRs: **English**
- Conversation with the user: **Portuguese (pt-BR)**

---

## 9. Execution Boundaries

Claude Code must NOT:

- Introduce new architectural layers without asking
- Change existing folder structures without confirmation
- Add new dependencies unless explicitly requested
- Introduce design patterns by default
- Create documentation files unless explicitly requested

Communication: be concise — focus on what's important, not obvious details.

If information is missing or ambiguous: do not guess, ask **one clear question**.

---

## 10. Documentation Maintenance

After changes that affect requirements or architecture:

- Update relevant docs in `docs/`
- Keep `docs/PRD.md` as a **template** (filled by `/generate-prd` skill)
- Write new documentation only inside `docs/`
